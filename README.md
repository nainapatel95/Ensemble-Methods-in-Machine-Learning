# Ensemble-Methods-in-Machine-Learning
Ensemble methods are a powerful strategy in machine learning that involves combining multiple models to improve the overall performance and robustness of the model. The idea is to leverage the strengths of different models while mitigating their weaknesses, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting.
