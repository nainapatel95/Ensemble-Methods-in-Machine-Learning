# Ensemble-Methods-in-Machine-Learning
Ensemble methods are a powerful strategy in machine learning that involves combining multiple models to improve the overall performance and robustness of the model. The idea is to leverage the strengths of different models while mitigating their weaknesses, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting.

* Ensemble methods can be categorized into three main types: bagging, boosting, and stacking. 
* Bagging involves creating multiple models and combining their predictions using techniques such as averaging or voting.
* Boosting involves training multiple models sequentially, with each model trying to correct the mistakes of the previous one.
* Stacking involves training multiple models and combining their predictions using a meta-model.

*The benefits of ensemble methods include improved robustness and generalizability, reduced overfitting and underfitting, and enhanced performance on unseen data. 
* They are widely used in various applications, including classification, regression, and anomaly detection.

In summary, ensemble methods are a powerful tool in machine learning that can help improve the performance and robustness of models by combining the strengths of multiple models.
